Predict Regioselectivity of electrophilic aromatic substitution
reactions in heteroaromatic systems. RegioSQM finds the aromatic CH
group with the highest proton affinity estimated by the PM3/COSMO method
using the MOPAC program. More information is available at the
[[https://doi.org/10.1039/C7SC04156J][RegioSQM paper]].

* Installation

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    - MOPAC (http://openmopac.net/)
    - RDKit (http://www.rdkit.org/docs/Install.html)
    - obabel (https://openbabel.org/docs/dev/Installation/install.html)
#+END_EXAMPLE

RegioSQM depends on MOPAC for quantum calculations, OpenBabel for some
formation convertion and RDkit in the python enviroment for everything
else.

* Usage

The workflow is as following

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    cd example

    # generate conformations from SMILES
    python ../regiosqm/regiosqm.py -g example.csv > example.csv

    # Run all .mop files with mopac
    # or submit them to a cluster
    ls *mop | parallel -j4 "mopac {}"

    # use the generated csv file to analyse all the 
    python ../regiosqm/regiosqm.py -a example.csv example.csv > example_results.csv
#+END_EXAMPLE

The results are now parseable from the results file, or viewable by 2D
structures with regioselective indicators (in svg format).
