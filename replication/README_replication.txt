The purpose of this folder is to store the more important input and
output data replicating the analysis performed to provide the SI of
RegioSQM's publication.  Changes in the code may alter the results,
and thus, the predicted sites for an EAS to occur.  Because a local
installation of RegioSQM offers the output both as an illustration 
(a .svg file per EAS group) as well as a plain text table, these
could be idenitified rapidly by a diff view of the relevant files.

It is known that the replicating compilation is still incomplete,
missing some of the larger sets (e.g., benzenes).

The first run of scripts for the beta-release of RegioSQM 2.0.0 beta
used Python 3.8.6rc1 (Sep 14, 2020), OpenBabel 3.1.0 (Jun 9, 2020),
MOPAC2016 (20.173L 64BITS), and RDKit (2019.09.1).
